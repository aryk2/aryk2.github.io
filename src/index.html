                Hello, my name is Aryeh and this is my last term at PSU. When I am not writing code, I enjoy listening to 
                music, playing ultimate frisbee and learning spanish. I currently live in New Jersey.

                    I joined the WGAC team at Matter Supply for a project that had been in development for one year already. When I joined, the site had been deployed and I was assigned to add new features to the site carefully following the design docs provided by the projects two designers. My largest contribution to date has been the content and functionality I added for the new holiday limited edition item, the Give Edition. This work mainly involved adding the new static images and text as well as several new modals. This also involved a large amount of configuration of the backend services to allow for a new product to be purchased and subscribed to.

                    My first project as an engineer at CDW Digital (IGNW at the time) was working as part of the team that redesigned and built a new site for Portland General Electric. My role started out as only work creating new components to be added to the front end of the site. As I continued working on the site, I had the opportunity to configure parts of the cloud infrastructure and backend GQL code. My largest contribution to the project was my work on the outage map feature. This is a google maps widget that displays and groups active power outages for all users that PG&E serves.
